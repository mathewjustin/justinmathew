Today was not an ordinary day for me; it began with the need to take an unexpected sick day. The morning unfolded with urgency as I planned to drop off my child, but fate had a different story in store. Around 9:30 AM, near Hopefarm in Whitefield, my day took a dramatic turn. As I attempted to overtake a car on the right, an elderly man crossing the road appeared in my path. Despite his slow pace and my high speed, I managed to brake just in time, reducing the impact of the collision. The man, although not severely injured, fell and sustained minor scratches on his knees.

  

The incident drew immediate attention, and several passersby stopped to assist. My initial fear of confrontation was alleviated by my attempts to communicate in broken Kannada, which, to my relief, helped manage the situation. With my hands trembling, I turned to my wife and daughter, who were with me in the car, for a water bottle to tend to the injured man. After cleaning his face, we hurried him to Manipal Hospital for medical attention.

  

Remarkably, the man expressed his gratitude throughout the ordeal. Upon arrival at the hospital, initial examinations showed his heart rate was normal, but what shocked me was learning about his age, 75, and that he had two pacemakers. His resilience was notable, yet the concern for potential injuries due to his age was palpable. Fortunately, after further assessments and an X-ray, we were relieved to hear that there were no fractures, only a knee injury.

  

Throughout this time, the man remained conscious and trusting. His ability to call his son-in-law and wife brought a sense of comfort to him, and I did my best to provide reassurance. As we awaited the X-ray results, my brother joined me, offering his support. The news that there were no fractures brought a collective sigh of relief.

  

The atmosphere grew tense with the arrival of his wife and son-in-law, bracing themselves for the worst, fearing the accident had left him in a dire state. However, their anxiety was soon alleviated when they realized that, thanks to the prompt and compassionate actions taken, he was in stable condition. The moment served as a poignant reminder of the fragile nature of life and the importance of kindness in times of crisis.  

  

  

As conversations unfolded, the wife began to share more about their family's journey, particularly focusing on their son's challenges. Their son, once a manager at IBM, had taken a bold leap by moving to Singapore for work before returning to Bangalore. His career transition from the corporate world to starting his own real estate business marked a period of prosperity for the family. However, life's unpredictable nature struck hard when he suffered a stroke, an event that turned their lives upside down.

  

At just 45 years old, their son faced a daunting battle for recovery. The medical expenses were astronomical, draining nearly 45 to 50 lakhs from their savings, with hospital bills averaging around 90,000 per day over two months. Despite the financial strain, the progress he made was heartening; from being bedridden to sitting up, each small victory was celebrated. Yet, the emotional and financial toll of the situation was evident as his mother recounted their story, her eyes brimming with tears.

  

The narrative of their son's struggle and resilience added a layer of depth to the day's events, transforming a simple act of assistance into a profound connection between two families. The gratitude expressed by the elderly man's wife, punctuated by her blessing, "God Bless you and your family," resonated deeply, leaving an indelible mark on the heart.

  

In the end, as I ensured their safe return home and bid them farewell, the promise to keep their loved one safe from harm was not just a commitment to them but a reminder of the interconnectedness of our lives. The story of their son, a testament to human resilience in the face of adversity, underscored the day's experiences, enriching the fabric of this unexpected encounter with strands of hope, perseverance, and shared humanity.
