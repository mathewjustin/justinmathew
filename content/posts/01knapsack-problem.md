# 0/1 Knapsack problem

One of my gang member told me learning 0/1 knapsack problem will actually give you an edge when it comes to solving or detecting dp problems. Dynamic programming is something which always facinates me. Most of the times, i mean most of the times i may end up memorizing the dp equation. But when this comes naturally its one of the greatest flex. We all thinks where these are actually used, why we all need these algorithms for your daily job..etc, etc.

<p>
 But the truth is, these kind of problems and algoriths somehow makes your neurons to fire in a different way. May be you will start asking the right questions, may be there will be a one or two instances in your job where you will actually use one of these data strucruers or algorithms. Its like going to gym, there will be a day when you will actually use that strength you have built in the gym. But most of the time you will not use it. But still you go to gym, right? So lets start with the problem statement. There are few instances where i actually had to use a stack, and a file explorer which i built with a tree to render folder structure on the UI (You have crazy amount of ui library to do this now).

## Some introduction and thougts on dynamic programming.
